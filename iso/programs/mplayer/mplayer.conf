## MPlayer config file
##
## This file can be copied to /usr/local/etc/mplayer.conf and/or ~/.mplayer/config .
## If both exist, the ~/.mplayer/config's settings override the
## /usr/local/etc/mplayer.conf ones. And, of course command line overrides all.
## The options are the same as in the command line, but they can be specified
## more flexibly here. See below.
##

vo=netbasgi # To specify default video driver (see -vo help for
# list)
#ao=oss # To specify default audio driver (see -ao help for
# list)

#fs=yes # Enlarges movie window to your desktop's size.
# Used by drivers: all

vm=yes # Tries to change to a different videomode
# Used by drivers: dga2, x11, sdl

#bpp=24 # Force changing display depth.
# Valid settings are: 0, 15, 16, 24, 32
# may need 'vm=yes' too.
# Used by drivers: fbdev, dga2, svga, vesa

zoom=yes # Enable software scaling (powerful CPU needed)
# Used by drivers: svga, x11, vesa
