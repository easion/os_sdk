    This enhanced version of \a SDL_Rect includes a number of handy
    short-hand constructors. Since the class is derived from the
    SDL_Rect struct, it can be used in any context where an \a SDL_Rect
    is valid.
    
    \todo Extend the class with useful utility functions in regards to
    rectangles like intersections.
